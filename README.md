## How to play

The player's score is based on the number of paired cards found: 
	- The board seeks for remaining cards and increment the score each time the player flips two 		identical cards.
	- When two identical cards are found, they remain on the board (right side up).
	- If not, the game automatically turns them over again (face down).
